# MyTime_DiscordBot

My time conversion bot is the perfect tool for anyone on Discord who needs to quickly and easily convert times to their local timezone. Simply type in a time, and the bot will display it in the viewer's local time. Whether you're coordinating events with friends in different timezones, or just need to know what time it is on the other side of the world, my time conversion bot has you covered.
